# evolutionlab
EvolutionLab is my self-hosted mini-cloud — a living lab where a VPS, Raspberry Pis, and mini-PCs mesh together with Headscale and Traefik. Here I experiment with LLM chatbots, private cloud services, and edge-scale apps, pushing ideas from sketch to prototype. It’s an environment built to evolve fast, break limits, and spark new products.
